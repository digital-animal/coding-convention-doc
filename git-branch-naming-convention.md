Creating a proper and meaningful name for a feature branch in a Git repository is important for clarity and organization.<br> 
In your case, where you want to update reports in the `dev-zahid` branch and want the branch name to reflect the work and author, you can follow a naming convention.<br>
Here's a suggestion for a branch naming format:<br>

`bash
feature/{author-name}/{short-description}
`

Using this format, you can create a branch name like this:

`bash
feature/zahid/update-reports
`

Here's a breakdown of the naming convention:

- feature: This prefix indicates that it's a feature branch.
- `{author-name}`: Replace this with your name or a unique identifier to indicate who is working on the branch. In your case, it's "zahid."
- `{short-description}`: Provide a brief but descriptive name for the branch that reflects the work you're going to do. In your case, it's "update-reports."

This naming convention helps identify the purpose of the branch and who is working on it. 
It's also a good practice to use lowercase letters and hyphens for branch names to ensure compatibility across different platforms and maintain consistency.

To create the branch with this name, you can use the following command:
`bash
git checkout -b feature/zahid/update-reports dev-zahid
`
This command will create a new branch named `feature/zahid/update-reports` based on the `dev-zahid` branch and switch to it, allowing you to start working on your report updates.
